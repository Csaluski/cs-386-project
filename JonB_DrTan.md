Interviewee: Doctor Tan

When: 13:23, 7/10/21

Customer Segment: Academic Professor with a PHD 

Key insights:
 -Reduction of dupliction files while searching(and saving)in demand, 
 -not all researchers have databases to access shared topics
 -dates are of some importance while organizing research
 -most files are organized on google drive
 - there is little to no demand to talk to authors usally. 
  (if needed their email is usally searchable)
Quotes: 
"most research groups I participate in have 2 or 3 members, if the group is larger it will have 7 to 10"
"shared duplication of files becomes a hassle to orginize because it takes up space and time to sort,
removing this redundancy would be great."

Assessment: Nice to have

besides duplication reduction, having better annotation was mentioned. This would be an nice thing for Dr.Tan to have but not
life changing. 

addtional notes, Dr.Tan cites that as a bit older gentleman that he doesn't currently use databases for organization.
