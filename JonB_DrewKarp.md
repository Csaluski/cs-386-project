Interviewer: Jonathan Boal

Interviewee: Drew Karp

When: 14:37 7/10/21

Customer Segment: Masters, conducting research for Ohio State University
works in many research groups for a living. 12hours a day everyday

-in terms of people, research is ether a 1 on 1 with his Admin or is a 1 on 'rotating' group basis of 4
people (3 groups in total).

Key insights:
-annotation would be very nice for physical presentation.
-an instant highlighter to show where group is following during readings.
-If there was a Kindle feature for papers it would help speed up the process of getting files.
-annotation based around voice usage for afterthoughts
- use of slack, email and Google Drive/Docs for current file sharing
Quotes:
" if there was a way to get research papers... similar to getting books on kindle"
" 40% to 45% (of time) finding research papers, 15% to 20% storing and organizing,
40% annotatting and breaking down information. "
"It would be nice to leave voice files as notes on documents, with adjustable speed"( think 2x)
Assessment: overall Must have
- Must have strong annotation features
- group based organization of file uploads
- demand for single access to papers
- does not care for direct communication in the app unless through annotation.
