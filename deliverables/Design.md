Group 02 - "Pulp"

## 1. Description

Pulp is a website that allows its users to upload, view, and save papers for easy access for your research. There are currently two main features that we have running; users and papers. We have UserManager and PaperManager classes that handle the User and Paper classes and the Pulp class is an instance that handles that manager classes. Through the User class and section of the website you can create an account, login, access your profile, and edit your profile information which currently is just a name, an email, and a bio. On the other hand in paper you can upload, view, and edit a pdf. We also have a database implemented as a facade. Future implementations hope to add tags to the papers so papers can be sorted through.
