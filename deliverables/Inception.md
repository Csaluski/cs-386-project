# Project Inception

Group 02 - "Pulp"\
Date: 2021-07-12\


## 1. Introduction

Pulp is a software project with the end goal of making a website that is used to help researchers use academic papers. Currently, juggling a large amount of PDFs is a hassle. We want to make the process of sharing and analyzing papers easier. 

## 2. Initial value proposition and consumer segments

### IVP:
Pulp is a platform for communication and annotation of your research papers, enabling you to connect with the greater research community.

### Initial customer segments:
- Research professors
- Graduate candidates
- Undergraduate research students
- Enthusiasts who are conducting independent research

## 3. Interviews summary

- Interviewer: Jadon Fowler
  
When: Sunday, July 11

Customer Segment:
Software Engineer doing type theory research

Key insights:
- It is difficult to find code relating to a paper
- Finding related papers and their code would be helpful
- Implementations of theories from papers are scattered on GitHub, have a way to link to those

Quotes:
- "If I'm looking at an extension of dependent type theory then I should be able to find its implementation quickly"
- "Discussion sections on papers could link to other papers or code"

### Interview 4

Interviewer: Jonathan Boal

Interviewee: Cory Weber

When: 19:15, 7/11/21

Customer Segment: Master of Science, does research for intel and personal pursuits
- also helps with peer review

Key insights:
- wants a way to get better access to articles through a "non commercial license"
- needs better search engine
- different research groups have different levels of experience on a given topic in the field.
- Mendeley usage
Quotes:
- paraphrased here
 " basically a problem that occurs is that when looking for research in an advanced field is that
 key words are not valued in context but rather in raw semantics. This means that if one looks up a word,
 say 'MOSST Transistors', that the word will not always be the main topic of a paper but rather a footnote.
 having a methodology of find the .1% of papers would save significant amount of time"
Assessment: does not care

- simply put Mr. Weber would not need our application, the only portion of desire is based on search
optimization

### Interview 5

Interviewer: Jonathan Boal

Interviewee: Drew Karp

When: 14:37 7/10/21

Customer Segment: Masters, conducting research for Ohio State University
works in many research groups for a living. 12hours a day everyday

-in terms of people, research is ether a 1 on 1 with his Admin or is a 1 on 'rotating' group basis of 4
people (3 groups in total).

Key insights:
-annotation would be very nice for physical presentation.
-an instant highlighter to show where group is following during readings.
-If there was a Kindle feature for papers it would help speed up the process of getting files.
-annotation based around voice usage for afterthoughts
- use of slack, email and Google Drive/Docs for current file sharing
Quotes:
" if there was a way to get research papers... similar to getting books on kindle"
" 40% to 45% (of time) finding research papers, 15% to 20% storing and organizing,
40% annotatting and breaking down information. "
"It would be nice to leave voice files as notes on documents, with adjustable speed"( think 2x)
Assessment: overall Must have
- Must have strong annotation features
- group based organization of file uploads
- demand for single access to papers
- does not care for direct communication in the app unless through annotation.

### Interview 6

Interviewer: Jonathan Boal

Interviewee: Doctor Tan

When: 13:23, 7/10/21

Customer Segment: Academic Professor with a PHD

Key insights:
 -Reduction of duplication files while searching(and saving)in demand,
 -not all researchers have databases to access shared topics
 -dates are of some importance while organizing research
 -most files are organized on Google Drive
 - there is little to no demand to talk to authors usually.
  (if needed their email is usually searchable)
Quotes:
"most research groups I participate in have 2 or 3 members, if the group is larger it will have 7 to 10"
"shared duplication of files becomes a hassle to organize because it takes up space and time to sort,
removing this redundancy would be great."

Assessment: Nice to have

besides duplication reduction, having better annotation was mentioned. This would be a nice thing for Dr.Tan to have but not
life changing.

additional notes, Dr.Tan cites that as a bit older gentleman that he doesn't currently use databases for organization.

What is your education level?\
College graduate (bs)\
What do you do for work?\
Geologist\
What resources do you currently use to find those papers?\
Various institutional resources example scihub\
What areas do you research most often?\
Earth science\

Couple hours a week\
How do you spend that time, in terms of different activities?
Field work, research, measurements\
Where do you feel that you lose time in your research?\
Making sure measurements are made with uniform measurements and looking up terms and definitions to go with the research\
How do you currently engage with other academics in reference to these readings?\
Rarely ever, mainly talks to other science departments about merging ideas.\

Assesment:\
Although some features seem to be useful for him when needing quick conversions and research, since he works more in the
field than writing up papers and research the software would be used infrequently.
