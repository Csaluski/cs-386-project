## 4. Non-functional requirements
1. Discoverable interface - Onboarding must be quick to encourage people to move to our platform from their established platforms. We want a user to be able to explore and understand our interface in less than 15 minutes.
2. Fast queries - We want to have reactive searches that update live while typing, so queries must be quick. We want under 100 ms.
3. Fault tolerance - We must not have downtime if our users enter invalid data, or if requests to other online services fail. We will have error handling so that this is handled and the user is informed.
4. Confidentiality - Leaking private user annotations could lead to loss of value to our users. We will not be able to do in depth penetration testing as part of the product development, but we will have user accounts that secure information.

## 5. MVP
- We want to have user accounts, discussion threads, tag based saving, basic searching, and a citation graph in our minimum viable product.
- We will have a minimum implementation of these features with static data, with a live web interface that users can use to fully demo the product.
- We will manually evaluate each feature of the interface, checking that each piece of functionality still works after updates.
