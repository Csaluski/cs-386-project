## 5. Deployment
Initially we wanted to use AWS for our deployment, however for this initial deployment we decided to use Heroku, as we do not currently rely on a database or other external services.
This required less setup and only changing our code in a very small way to enable passing a port for the config.
The app is currently hosted [here](https://pulp-papers.herokuapp.com/), we have not yet purchased a real domain.
