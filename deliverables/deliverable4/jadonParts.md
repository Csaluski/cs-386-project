## Deliverable 4.1: Introduction

Pulp is a collaboration platform that enables academics to be more effective in their literary research by enabling more effective searching and collaborative annotations. The current system allows you to login, edit your account, and  view papers. Future systems will allow you more customizable options on profile settings, uploading and saving papers to your user account, and a search engine to help you filter through papers. Future goals also include an annotation, and a group environment setting to help your research team communicate information more efficiently.

We have a Web Server built in Java using Vert.x. For a database, we use PostgreSQL and connect to it using JDBC. For the frontend, we use HTML + CSS + JS and we use Handlebars templates to insert data into the HTML. To build the application, we use the Gradle build system. Docker is used for packaging the webapp. GitHub Actions is used for CI & CD to build and deploy the webapp to AWS.

## Deliverable 4.6: Licensing

We have decided to use the MIT License as it is a very simple license that lets people do almost anything with the project, such as forking it or creating copies of it.

## Deliverable 4.7: Readme File

This is actually not just the readme. This is the existence of the Readme, Contributing, Code of Conduct, and License.
