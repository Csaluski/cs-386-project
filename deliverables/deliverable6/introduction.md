## Deliverable 6.1: Introduction

Pulp is a web based platform to assist individuals performing literature research to save time and reduce frustration.
By providing a service to sort their literature searches, Pulp will help researchers keep the important information at
their fingertips instead of having to re-search it.

Currently, Pulp has a profile feature that allows users to keep track of their information. User may upload papers and
view them in the browser. There are fields to store the paper's pertinent information, including author, abstract, and
DOI. After viewing a paper, users may associate the paper with an existing tag or create a new tag to personalize the
sorting of  their papers. User may view a tag to review all associated papers, thus reducing the time a user has to
search for information they previously reviewed. In case of any mistakes or if a user changes their mind on how they
want to note something, user profiles, paper details, and tag information are all able to be edited.
