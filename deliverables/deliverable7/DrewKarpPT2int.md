thoughts on pulp?

pretty cool

-how was the functionality of the site?

yes, [what do you mean by that] the site worked well for being developed in under a month.

- on a scale of 1 to 10( 1 being never, 10 being everyday) how often could you see yourself using this project?

8, having a site that can be shared over a projector is useful.

-would you use this product in it's current state?

  yes, I could host it with other researchers.

  --if not why?/what would it need to be useable--

- any questions?

none

  any questions for the future--- if this project were to go further would comments, password, annotations, and PDF resizing be developed? -[yes]

  -closing thoughts on the project?

 if there was teaching function like group login, comments from group, status of paper for assignments.
