Hannah Follow up Interview with Mostafa Mahmoudi

How was the functionality of the site?

    It's simple, though it's not complete.
Opinions on Features:


     Good tag feature for linking to file. I would want the tag to be able to go to a specific paragraph.
On a scale of 1 to 10( 1 being never, 10 being everyday) how often could you see yourself using this project?

    Where it is now 0, where it could be after more work and features 10.
would you use this product in it's current state?

    Not where it is now.
If not why?/what would it need to be useable


    Currently it is too simple. Being able to save specific tables and figures for comparison outside of the pdfs, and I don't see it needing a community factor. If those were implimented I would use is everyday.
Any questions?

    No
Closing thoughts on the project?

    I hope someone can continue this project. It's a first step toward the project. On the first interview I thought the idea would make a useful tool that I and everyone I know could use. I would have used Python for this project instead and made an application before a website.
