Quotes:
- paraphrased here
 " basically a problem that occurs is that when looking for research in an advanced field is that
 key words are not valued in context but rather in raw semantics. This means that if one looks up a word,
 say 'MOSST Transistors', that the word will not always be the main topic of a paper but rather a footnote.
 having a methodology of find the .1% of papers would save significant amount of time"
Assessment: does not care

- simply put Mr. Weber would not need our application, the only portion of desire is based on search
optimization
