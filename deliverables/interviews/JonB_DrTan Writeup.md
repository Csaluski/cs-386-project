Customer Segment: Academic Professor with a PHD

Key insights:
 -Reduction of duplication files while searching(and saving)in demand,
 -not all researchers have databases to access shared topics
 -dates are of some importance while organizing research
 -most files are organized on Google Drive
 - there is little to no demand to talk to authors usually.
  (if needed their email is usually searchable)
Quotes:
"most research groups I participate in have 2 or 3 members, if the group is larger it will have 7 to 10"
"shared duplication of files becomes a hassle to organize because it takes up space and time to sort,
removing this redundancy would be great."

Assessment: Nice to have

besides duplication reduction, having better annotation was mentioned. This would be a nice thing for Dr.Tan to have but not
life changing.

additional notes, Dr.Tan cites that as a bit older gentleman that he doesn't currently use databases for organization.
