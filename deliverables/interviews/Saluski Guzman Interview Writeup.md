Customer Segment:
PhD. student, active in research

Key insights:
- Small (12) research group that already has communication channels with infrequent external communication
- Need citation graph of papers
- Tagging of papers
- Visualizations of groups of papers

Quotes:
- "When doing reading work a citation graph would be great for helping navigate further research work"
- "It would be good to have every paper you've ever reviewed in one place."

Assessment:
- Citation graph (Must have)
- Keyword search features (Nice to have)
- Saving papers (Must have)
- Organization Features (Must have)
- Annotation feature (Nice to have)
- Unit conversions (Don't care)
- In team communication (Don't care)
- Larger scope communication (Don't care)


# Notes:
1. PhD Student
2. yes
3. computer network performance, low cost cellular network solutions, social media analysis
4. regularly, often each week


Creating new research projects, evaluating if there's correlation between lacks of coverage and other features
Specifically government lapses, FCC overestimates.
IEEE, ACM journals, Arxiv.
Yes success finding papers, and uses citations a lot.

Search process:
Currently working on PhD comprehensive exam
- We want to start broad, and find the papers most profound for a topic.
- Initial search process takes longer, spend most time identifying a handful of papers for related works
- Specific research takes more effort than finding profound papers.

How could be more effective?
PhD comprehensive exam:
- When doing reading work a citation graph would be great for helping navigate further research work
- A literal directed graph of citations would be very very useful
- You will find niche papers that don't have an extracted bibliography

Paper organization process:
- Documents to organize them, like a mini annotated bibliography, as well as tracking information

Peer communication:
- Shared documents, Overleaf or Google Docs
- Slack and Zoom
- Getting in touch with other researchers by networking mostly
- Infrequent email communication
- Currently in communication with less than a dozen
- No specific communication issues, platforms exist

Overall literary research experience:
- Organization
    - Paper tags
    - More visual element, grouping
    - Grouping based on tags and freeform
- More annotation options
    - Bubbles or rows on a chart

It would be good to have every paper you've ever reviewed in one place.
Some way to easily review stashed papers and review them, then share those notes

Anything I should have asked but didn't?
Not really, pretty good overview.
