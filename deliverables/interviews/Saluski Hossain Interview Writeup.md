Interview participants:
 - Interviewed: Nazmul Hossain
 - Interviewer: Charles Saluski

When: 2021-07-11 15:00

Customer Segment: PhD student

Key insights:
- Small (4) research group that already has communication channels with infrequent external communication
- Centralizing the research process would be valuable
- Do not need more communication platforms, but a collaborative platform where papers can be collected is useful
- We can't solve paywalls, but even without full text it's useful to be able to navigate them.

Quotes:
- "The biggest issue is that I'm doing everything in different places, Google Scholar, Mendeley, saving the papers, a Google sheet."
- "Finding the relevant email thread when your inbox is full is really challenging"

Assessment: Nice to have

# Notes

## What you do?
- Google Scholar, similar tools
- Maintaining a library with Mendeley
- How to set up and maintain networks, especially low power
- LoRAX, bridge digital divide and let the users know that the system exists
- Novel user interface and user experiences techniques
- Fall 2020 started heavy literature review, for PhD comprehensive review main focus
- Daily research on specific topics, most recent
- Mendeley, take notes, download paper, compile notes to Google Sheet

### More effective?
- When I'm searching the main difficulty is that papers are behind a paywall.
-

### How to discover further?
- Google Scholar, most recent and most cited from keyword search
- Following citations is important, profound papers important and following citations forward is useful


## Organization

### Overall approach
- Mendeley and Google Drive backup folder
- Browser extension to directly export paper to Mendeley
- Google doc as backup

### Tracking information
- Spreadsheet, title, authors, abstract, personal notes
- If there's enough time, start with the abstract and go through, mostly abstract and results
- Search by title and author, year
- Folders are themselves niche, so everything is pretty relevant

## Communication
- Small research group, 4 people
- Zoom meetings, issues you're facing, other topics that need more research.
- Slack channel, most of the small stuff on Slack
- Email rarely used, try to avoid. "Finding the relevant email thread when your inbox is full is really challenging"
- Rarely reach out to communicate with paper authors, don't need to usually, but can sometimes need to for fundamental questions.
- Reach out if it was easier only if it was really fundamental questions, email covers this.
- Communication is not a big issue overall
- The main difficulty we're facing is the hardware prototype and conducting measurements.


## Overall improvement
- "The biggest issue is that I'm doing everything in different places, Google Scholar, Mendeley, saving the papers, a Google sheet."
- Combine searching and selecting papers and saving them
- Most important is organizing papers and notes, then discovery
