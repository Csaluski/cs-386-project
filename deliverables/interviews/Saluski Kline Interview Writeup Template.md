Interview Participants:
- Charles Saluski
- Sarah Kline

When: 2021-07-10 13:00

Customer Segment:
Undergraduate research assistant

Key insights:
- Small (4) immediate research group, mainly asynchronous communication techniques and live meetings.
- Communication is contained within group, infrequent external communication, but IMing would make that more attractive.
- Better methods to search for papers, collect abstracts and citations.
- Support for multiple, currently existing, workflows of organization, all able to be shared and collaborated on.

Quotes:
"Something like Google Drive where multiple people can collaborate, with designated meeting times"
"A sidebar that pops up as you're scrolling through, it'll show information on this paper"

Assessment: Must-have


Notes:
Neuroscience research, cognitive research. Empathy and EEG.
Google scholar, Cline library, researchgate rarely

Current methods:
- Key word searches on Google scholar, look through papers and see if they're applicable.
- Small niche, relatively new and few papers.
- Many by supervising professor.
- Google scholar filters out papers by that professor.

How to improve?
- Currently use keyword searches plus filtering, fragmentation of papers across sources proves limiting.
- Pay gates are frustrating, but if a user knows they're getting something worthwhile it's okay
- Looks at citations, both citations forward and backward.
- Starts with keyword searches, then following citations.
- Asked in a too leading way, but citations being easier to explore would be useful.
- Sidebar that has abstract of linked papers

Organization:
- Spreadsheet of papers, with relevant notes taken in other columns
- Would be better to see all the papers at once, instead of looking at columns
- Tags would be useful

Research communication:
- Lab meetings, once a week
- Email, Zoom, Google Drive, no instant messaging
- Email is better than instant messaging for longer topics
- Regularly communicates with 4 people in research group
- Very rarely reaches out over email to other professors, but if it were more available instant messaging would be preferred
- Collaborating on reading multiple papers efforts can be duplicated, hard to keep papers organized.
- Something like Google Drive where multiple people can collaborate, with designated meeting times

Overall biggest improvement, centralized location of papers, even if just abstracts and citations

Most important is improving experience of searching for papers, then improving experience of collaboration, and last improving communication
