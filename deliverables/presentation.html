## Serverside

* Java Web Server using Vert.x

<!-- We decided on using Java for our main programming language for the
    Web Server. We used a serverside framework called Vert.x to
    deliver the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to the browser. -->

--

* Simple data objects

<!-- To manage all of the different types of data we have, we used very
    simple objects made from only a few fields. These classes consisted of
    useful -->

--

* Manager classes for the data

<!-- To manage these simple objects, we used separate manager classes. These
    classes are responsible for creating, removing, and uploading objects to
    and from the database. -->

--

* JDBC Wrapper for Database Connection

<!-- We used the Java Connectivity Database API, or JDBC, to connect to the database. -->

--

## Clientside

* Handlebars Templates

<!-- We used a templating language called Handlebars to transfer data from the
    web server to the client. This data is embedded into the HTML when the browser
    requests a page. -->

name: conclusion
# Conclusion

--

* Trajectory

--

  - It was rough

--

* Learned

--

  - Everything

  - Have a lot to learn

--

  - Vert.X framework

  - Back end web development

  - Group work is difficult!

  - Everyone has a different experience level coming in

  - Brushing up on Java

---
# Conclusion
### Hindsight

* Better onboarding
  - Tuesday we found a great Udemy course on Vert.x, should've looked earlier and assigned it week 1.
* More popular and documented framework
  - Vert.x 4 released December 2020, resources not updated
* Familiar programming paradigm
  - Vert.x is an async framework, we should've gone for imperative

--

### Lessons
* Communicate capabilities!
* Learn early
* Don't incorporate unfamiliar technologies
* If possible, start with a full stack already setup
  - Docker compose, with database and example site, and working automated deployment.
