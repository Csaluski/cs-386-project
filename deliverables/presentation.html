# Conclusion

--

* Trajectory

--

  - It was rough

--

* Learned

--

  - Everything

  - Have a lot to learn

--

  - Vert.X framework

  - Back end web development

  - Group work is difficult!

  - Everyone has a different experience level coming in

  - Brushing up on Java

---
# Conclusion
### Hindsight

* Better onboarding
  - Tuesday we found a great Udemy course on Vert.x, should've looked earlier and assigned it week 1.
* More popular and documented framework
  - Vert.x 4 released December 2020, resources not updated
* Familiar programming paradigm
  - Vert.x is an async framework, we should've gone for imperative

--

### Lessons
* Communicate capabilities!
* Learn early
* Don't incorporate unfamiliar technologies
* If possible, start with a full stack already setup
  - Docker compose, with database and example site, and working automated deployment.
